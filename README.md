# Wear4PDmove

Ontology aim/scope:

Wear4PDmoveOnto aims to semantically integrate heterogeneous data such as dynamic/stream data  (collected from wearables) and static/historic data (stored in PHR databases), in order to represent personal health knowledge in the form of a KG (i.e., PHKG), supporting health apps’ reasoning capabilities for high-level events recognition (e.g., ‘missing dose’ or  ‘patient fall’ event).

Ontology requirements (briefly): 

The ontology must:

R1.Represent knowledge about a) patients’ movement b) patients’ daily activities, c) details of their personal health record.

R2.Semantically integrate data from heterogeneous sources a) wearables, b) personal health records, in order to provide a unified view of personal health in real-time (monitoring and alerting).

R3.Reason with unified personal health data represented in the form of a KG.

R4.Support high-level events recognition in the personal health domain for PD, such as a ‘missing dose’ event or a ‘patient fall’ event.
